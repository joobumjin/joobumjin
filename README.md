# ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Bumjin 

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer and New Grad from Brown CS!

## ðŸ’¬ About Me

* Recently graduated with an ScB from Brown CS, with a particular focus on Machine Learning
  * (Tentatively) working through an ScM as well!

* As a student, I was a Undergrad TA for 3 years with Brown's CS1470 / 2470 (Graduate) Deep Learning and CS1430 Computer Vision courses. 
  * As a TA, I've developed assignments about Backpropagation, Autoencoders, and ViTs 
  * I've also workshopped new course content with Transformers and foundation models like CLIP

* I also did applied Deep Learning research with the Singh Lab @ Brown. 
  * Currently, I'm wrapping up research on a Graph Convolutional Network which attempts to better predict stem cell function and maturity!
