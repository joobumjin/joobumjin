# 👋 hi! i'm Bumjin 

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer and current Master's student at Brown CS!

Check out [my portfolio here](https://bumjinjoo.com), or take a look around and see what kind of work I've been up to!

## 💬 about me

* I'm a current ScM student at BrownCS studying machine learning with a particular interest in multimodal, self supervised learning!
  * I also completed my ScB with Honors here as well!

* As a student, I was a Undergrad TA for 3 years with Brown's CS1470 / 2470 (Graduate) Deep Learning and CS1430 Computer Vision courses 
  * As a TA, I've developed assignments about Backpropagation, Autoencoders, and ViTs 
  * I've also workshopped new course content with Transformers and foundation models like CLIP

* I also did applied Deep Learning research with the Singh Lab @ Brown
  * Currently, I'm wrapping up research on a Graph Convolutional Network which attempts to better predict stem cell function and maturity and unify multiple distinct models into a single multitasking one!


Feel free to reach out to me at my email [first].[last]@gmail.com. I'd love to talk about work, jobs, or just chat about ML!
